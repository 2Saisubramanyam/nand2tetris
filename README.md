These are my (Jochem Wichers Hoeth) personal implementations of the programming assignments for the very entertaining on-line couse "Nand to Tetris - Building a Modern Computer From First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. I can seriously recommend it for any coder who wants to know what's going on under the hood!

Follow the course yourself at Coursera:
* Part 1: https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home
* Part 2: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/home/welcome

See https://www.nand2tetris.org for more information about the course.

Please do not use my solutions for your own assignments in the course. Don't spoil the fun for yourself! After you've completed the assignments on your own, you're more than welcome to compare your solutions with mine and tell me where you think I can improve. :-)

The `projects` directory contains my solutions and follow the same directory structure as the course material.
